# Mental-State-Improvement-Project

This project is designed to send a beautiful image paired with an inspiring quote to a Microsoft Teams channel on a daily basis. The service fetches random images from Unsplash and quotes from Quotable, then posts them to a specified Teams channel using a webhook URL.
